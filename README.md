# What is FIL Project Management App v1?

FIL Project Management App v1 was the runner-up prototype for the [Spring 2014 COEN275/COEN160 in-class design competition](http://scu.edu/engineering/frugal/gallery/2012/Student-Projects.cfm) held by the Frugal Innovation Lab at Santa Clara University. The application allows coordinators and volunteers from the lab to search, store, and retrieve FIL project information to/from a **SQL database** in an easy to use and accessible GUI platform. FIL Project Management App v1 is a desktop application written in **Java** using the **Swing API** which utilizes the following libraries: **JDK 1.8** is used as the default Java library. **EclipseLink JPA2.1** is used to import the JPA library used for managing the calls to the SQL database. **MySQL-Connector 5.1.31** is utilized to access the SQL database within the Java application.

# Application State and Future Additions

The ability to store and retrieve project information has been fully implemented. The user can store project data such as the collaborating students, faculty, and participants. The user is able to add, update, or delete projects and related information using an interactive table in the project management screen. Additional categories, tags, media, and file types can be added to the projects. Users can also use the other data field to add special data to the project. The search function allows the user to search for projects using the projectâ€™s title. The user can filter results using the filter function to narrow the results of the retrieved projects. The project statistic page allow the user to analyze the state of the projects in the Frugal Innovation Lab. The user account page was not fully implemented. Users can currently add, update, or delete users. However, users are able gain admin access without supplying proper credentials.
